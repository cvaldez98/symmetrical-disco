I wanted to build a markov chain that was fed trump's tweets and would be able to have a nice GUI. This is what I came up with in a few days, I've come accross some challenges and I have done a lot of reading. There's something fishy about the markov chain since it's repeating a lot about Saudi Arabia. The html needs to get changed to something more aesthetic and I have no idea how to make the button work on the HTML page (supposedly I need AJAX to make Javascript interact with my python
script). 
Anyways all help is welcome. Thanks for checking this out.
